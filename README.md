Introducing Uranium, a mod designed to take your Minecraft experience to a new level of challenge by introducing intentional lag. This mod makes the game unplayable, testing your patience and resilience.

Uranium 0.1 Overview
Uranium is a unique modification for the Minecraft client that creates deliberate lag, transforming your game into a difficult and unpredictable adventure. Instead of smoothing out frame rates and reducing micro-stutter, Uranium amplifies these aspects, making the game nearly unplayable.

Uranium is compatible with Fabric and Forge mod loaders, allowing you to integrate it into your game regardless of your preferred modding platform. It achieves this without altering the visual style of Minecraft, keeping the authentic look while making gameplay far more challenging.
